# mie-theory-in-absorbing-medium

I took the mie codes from: https://bitbucket.org/planetarysystemresearch/absmie/src/master/
They are the fortran conversion of Mathematica Mie code for sphere in absorbing medium by Sudiarta

I compiled the codes for Windows and performed a comparison study with the traditional Mie theory for non absorbing medium.
The code to be run is main.m
